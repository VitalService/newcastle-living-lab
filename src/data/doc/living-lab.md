**About the Newcastle Living Lab**

The Newcastle Living Lab is a web-based tool and is based on the use of
multi-screen visualisations and animations. It's design and use intention is to
allow participants to negotiate shared intentions and to co-produce reflections
and designs of envisaged socio-technical systems. This allows participants to
appropriate and operationalise the existing and required architectural
discourse.

This Living Lab Player is a way to mimic a much larger Living Lab session, on a local device, for an individual or a smaller audience. In many projects, a Living Lab will have more than one "View" - typically another external computer display. Within the Living Lab Player, this is replicated using multiple browser tabs. To facilitate this, it is **_highly recommended_** that projects with multiple browser tabs are juxtaposed side-by-side in order to participate in an optimum Living Lab experience.
